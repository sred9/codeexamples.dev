There three ways to create a string in JavaScript.

1. The first way is using single quotes `''`.

```js
const str  = 'Hello'
```

2. The second way is using the double quotes `""`.

```js
const str  = "Hello"
```

3. The final way of creating a string is using the backticks.

```js
const str = `Hello`
```
